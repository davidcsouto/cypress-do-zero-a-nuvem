# 🌲 Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud ☁️

Sample project for the "Cypress, from ZEro to the Cloud" course of the Talking About Testing online school.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

> I've used versions `2.45.1`, `v20.12.0` and `10.5.0` of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

## Instalation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

In this project, you can run the tests on a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress APP on a desktop viewport.

### Mobile

Run `npm run test:mobile` to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.
